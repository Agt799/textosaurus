## Hello, dear contributors!!!

You can contribute to Textilosaurus project in a several different ways:

- by translating Textilosaurus to some other languages (create new feature request for your localization [here](https://github.com/martinrotter/textilosaurus/issues/new)),
- by submitting pathes and pull requests (see [here](https://github.com/martinrotter/textilosaurus/pulls)),
- by reporting [bugs](https://github.com/martinrotter/textilosaurus/issues/new),
- by donating some money to support and encourage developers (see below and [here](https://liberapay.com/martinrotter)).

### Donations
Textilosaurus does not have dedicated forums or home website. It uses GitHub to host all its sources and other artifacts. The donations are only a way to show that you (as a user) really like Textilosaurus and I do my job with it right.

Note that donations are of course **NOT** required at all. You do greater service to Textilosaurus if you just use it and report bugs it has. :)
