## Hello, dear contributors!!!

You can contribute to Textosaurus project in a several different ways:

- by translating Textosaurus to some [other languages](https://crowdin.com/project/textosaurus),
- by submitting patches and pull requests (see [here](https://github.com/martinrotter/textosaurus/pulls)),
- by reporting [bugs](https://github.com/martinrotter/textosaurus/issues/new),
- by donating some money to support and encourage developers (see below and [here](https://martinrotter.github.io/donate)).

### Donations
Textosaurus does not have dedicated forums or home website. It uses GitHub to host all its sources and other artifacts. The donations are only a way to show that you (as a user) really like Textosaurus and I do my job with it right.

Note that donations are of course **NOT** required at all. You do greater service to Textosaurus if you just use it and report bugs it has. :)
