This release marks big milestone in development of Textilosaurus. At this point, all features I need from text editor, are implemented. In upcoming releases, there will be primarily performance enhancements, GUI polishments and bug fixes.

Added:
* Experimental support for color schemes. Color schemes offer these features:
    * all custom schemes saved in single .ini file with simple format,
    * schemes are valid for all supported Languages,
    * simple scheme editor in application settings.
* Auto-indent is now switchable per-document and is assignable to shortcut.
* FS sidebar has better keyboard integration.
* Initial support for context-based color schemes for some source code kinds.

Changed:
* Application user data (settings etc.) are now read directly from "data" subfolder, extra subsubfolder "config" is now not created. Check "About Application -> Paths" dialog for exact information.
* Highlighting of occurrences of currently selected text polished a bit.
* Scintilla updated to latest master (4.0.3).
