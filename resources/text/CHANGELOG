This release marks big milestone in development of Textosaurus. At this point, all features I need from text editor, are implemented. In upcoming releases, there will be primarily performance enhancements, GUI polishments and bug fixes.

Added:
* Experimental support for color schemes. Color schemes offer these features:
    * all custom schemes saved in single .ini file with simple format,

* FS sidebar has better keyboard integration.
* Initial support for context-based color schemes for some source code kinds.
